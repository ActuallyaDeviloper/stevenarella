# Steven (Rust)

A Minecraft client coded in Rust. Ported from [steven-go](https://github.com/Thinkofname/steven).
Don't expect it to go anywhere, just doing this for fun.

I generally am on the `irc.spi.gt` irc network in the `#think` channel.

## Building
For more detailed info and platform specific instructions check the [wiki](https://github.com/Thinkofname/steven-rust/wiki/Compiling-and-or-running]).

Currently requires SDL2 and OpenSSL to build.

`cargo build --release`

## Running

### Standalone

Just running steven via a double click (Windows) or `./steven` (everything else)
will bring up a login screen followed by a server list which you can select a server
from.

### Via the Offical Minecraft launcher

Currently not supported (yet)
